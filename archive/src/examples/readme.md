# Examples

The main [hacspec repository] contains a set of [example specifications].
In this section we pull out some interesting bits to demonstrate the hacspec
language.

There's also a provider that bundles the different cryptographic primitives
into a single library.
The provider implements the [RustCrypto traits] in order to facilitate interoperability.
